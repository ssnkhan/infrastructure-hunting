### Date Filters
Appended after the `FROM` or `INNER JOIN` statements, can be used to constrain results to a specific time period.


#### By Today
``` sql
WHERE date(artifacts.created_at) = date('now')
```


#### Between a Date Range
``` sql
SELECT
    alerts.title AS "Alert Type",
    COUNT(*) AS "Total"
FROM artifacts
INNER JOIN alerts ON alerts.id = artifacts.alert_id
WHERE date(artifacts.created_at) >= "2021-01-01"
  AND date(artifacts.created_at) <= "2021-04-01"
GROUP BY
    "Alert Type"
ORDER BY
    "Total" DESC,
    lower("Alert Type") ASC
```


#### _n_ Days Ago
``` sql
WHERE date(artifacts.created_at) = date('now', '-7 day')
```

#### _n_ Months Ago
``` sql
WHERE date(artifacts.created_at) = date('now', '-1 month')
```


#### _n_ Years Ago
``` sql
WHERE date(artifacts.created_at) = date('now', '-1 year')
```

### API / Providers

#### Detections by Provider
Helpful in understanding reliance on specific data sources.
``` sql
SELECT
    source AS "Provider",
    count(*) AS "Total"
FROM alerts
INNER JOIN artifacts ON artifacts.alert_id = alerts.id
GROUP BY
    "Provider"
ORDER BY
    "Provider" ASC
```


#### Days Since Last Alert by Provider
Helpful in detecting API health concerns â€” including API quota exhaustion, and staleness in provider data.
``` sql
SELECT
    "Provider",
    "Last Observed",
    round(julianday(date("now")) - julianday("Last Observed")) AS "Days Since Last Alert"
FROM (
       SELECT
           source AS "Provider",
           strftime("%Y-%m-%d", artifacts.created_at) AS "Last Observed"
       FROM alerts
       INNER JOIN artifacts ON artifacts.alert_id = alerts.id
       ORDER BY
           "Last Observed" DESC)
GROUP BY
    "Provider"
ORDER BY
    "Provider" ASC
```
